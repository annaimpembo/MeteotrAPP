# MeteotrAPP: A Weather-Based Chord Progression Generator

## What is WeatherChord?

WeatherChord is a web app designed to inspire musicians and music lovers by generating chord progressions based on real-time weather conditions. By categorizing atmospheric conditions into four main types —**Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, and Snowy**— the app assigns a unique harmonic character to each, allowing users to explore different moods and textures in their music.

Each weather condition is associated with a specific chord scale:
- ☀️ **Sunny** → Major Scale (bright, uplifting harmonies)  
- 🌧️ **Rainy** → Minor Scale (moody, emotional progressions)  
- ☁️ **Cloudy** → Suspended 4th (floating, unresolved tension)  
- ❄️ **Snowy** → Major 7th (soft, dreamy atmospheres)  

The app suggests chords tailored to the detected weather and lets users experiment with various musical parameters, including:
- 🎵 **Chord Selection & Playback:** Choose from suggested chords and loop them to build progressions.  
- 🎚️ **BPM & Time Signature Control:** Adjust the tempo and rhythmic feel of your loops.  
- 🔀 **Customizable Chord Order:** Arrange and reorder the selected chords to create unique sequences.  
- ✨ **Weather-Specific Effects:** Each condition comes with dedicated audio effects that enhance the overall sound.  

Whether you're looking for inspiration, experimenting with harmonies, or simply having fun with music creation, WeatherChord provides a unique way to blend meteorology and sound design. Let the weather shape your next musical idea!
